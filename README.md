# Technical Choices

-Vite as it is lighter for small frontend projects compared to Next.js<br>
-React Router DOM for Routing<br>
-Axios for easier API Consuming,automatic json parsing, it could be omitted as it is an extra dependency on the project but it this is a small test project of 3 pages<br>
-Bootstrap for ready made CSS classes<br>
